  A milky glass theme for Home Assistant

<hr>

This is based on [Henrik](https://www.reddit.com/user/Trollet_/)'s [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/c4s28m/my_current_lovelace_ui_constructive_feedback_is/) with a few additions of mine


## how to use

### Add the font
Right now, this theme requires you to add the `Comfortaa` font as a resource to your lovelace configuration:
```yaml
resources:
  - url: https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Comfortaa&display=swap
  type: css
```

### Install the theme
Clone this repository into your `/config/themes/` folder or copy the `kibibit.yaml` file individually.
